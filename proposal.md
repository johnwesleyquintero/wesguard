## WesGuard Enhancement Proposal

This document outlines proposed enhancements for the WesGuard application, categorized for clarity and prioritization.

**I. Core Enhancements (High Impact, Broad Appeal)**

* **System Optimization:**
    * **Registry Cleaner:** Scans and safely cleans invalid Windows registry entries, improving system startup and performance.  Includes registry backup functionality.
    * **Startup Manager:**  Allows users to view, manage, enable/disable startup programs, improving boot times. Displays impact ratings for each program.
    * **Process Manager:** An advanced task manager showing CPU/memory usage per process, enabling users to kill unresponsive processes and set process priorities.  Highlights resource-intensive applications.

* **Advanced Monitoring:**
    * **Temperature Monitoring:** Tracks CPU and GPU temperatures, provides thermal throttling alerts, and generates historical temperature charts. Includes fan speed monitoring and battery health information (for laptops) such as capacity, health status, charging cycles, and power consumption analysis. Offers battery optimization tips.
    * **Network Monitor:** Displays real-time bandwidth usage per application, performs network speed tests, monitors connection quality, and tracks data usage.


**II. Security & Privacy Enhancements**

* **Privacy Cleaner:** Clears browser history, cookies, and cache. Removes recent documents and search history. Offers secure file deletion (data overwrite). Includes Windows privacy settings optimization.
* **Duplicate File Finder:** Scans for duplicate files across drives using content-based comparison (not just name). Provides a preview before bulk deletion, reclaiming significant disk space.
* **File Shredder:** Securely deletes files using multiple overwrite algorithms, preventing recovery. Features a drag-and-drop interface and scheduled deletion options.


**III. Performance Tools**

* **Memory Optimizer:** Analyzes and optimizes RAM usage, clearing memory leaks and managing memory efficiently. Includes system memory defragmentation.
* **Disk Defragmenter:** Analyzes disk fragmentation and performs smart defragmentation scheduling with SSD optimization (TRIM support) and boot-time defragmentation options.


**IV. System Utilities**

* **System Information Dashboard:** Provides detailed hardware specifications, driver version checking and updates, system stability reports, and benchmark comparisons.
* **Backup Manager:** Offers automated file backups, system restore point creation, cloud backup integration, and incremental backup support.
* **Windows Updates Manager:** Controls Windows update behavior, allows hiding problematic updates, scheduling installations, and provides update history with rollback capabilities.


**V. User Experience Improvements**

* **Themes & Customization:** Includes multiple color themes (dark, light, custom), customizable dashboard layouts, a widget system, and personalized shortcuts.
* **Scheduling System:** Allows scheduling of all optimization tasks, offering smart scheduling based on usage patterns, maintenance reminders, and automated weekly/monthly cleanups.
* **Reports & Analytics:** Generates system health reports, tracks performance improvements, displays usage statistics and trends, and allows exporting reports as PDFs.


**VI.  Advanced & Future Considerations**

* **Plugin System:** Enables third-party plugin support, custom optimization scripts, and community-contributed tools via a developer API.
* **Cloud Sync:** Allows syncing settings across devices, cloud-based configuration backup, multi-device management, and remote system monitoring.
* **AI-Powered Optimization:**  Utilizes machine learning for system analysis, predictive maintenance suggestions, personalized optimization recommendations, and smart resource allocation.
* **Mobile Companion App:** Offers remote system monitoring, push notifications for system alerts, remote optimization triggers, and a system status dashboard.
* **Browser Extension:** Provides quick system stats in the browser, one-click optimization, privacy protection during browsing, and resource usage alerts.


**VII. Prioritization Recommendation**

For initial implementation, we recommend focusing on:

1. **Registry Cleaner:** High impact, frequently requested.
2. **Startup Manager:** Significant performance gains.
3. **Temperature Monitoring:** Crucial for system health.
4. **Themes & Customization:** Enhances user experience and adoption.

This phased approach allows for iterative development and user feedback, ensuring the most impactful features are delivered first.  Further prioritization can be determined based on user needs and resource availability.
